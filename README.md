# React Page - Reserve to Dine

This is a group project for Human Computer Interfaces at Daytona State College.

Hali provided some content for the code, thanks Hali!

This web page was not required for the class, but was fun to implement parts of our UI to a functional page. The semester ended and the page was not completed, it is left at a very rough stage. I may revisit it in the future.

This page utilizes Tailwinds for styling
